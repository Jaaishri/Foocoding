        The 2020 presidential election is still a ways off, but you’re forgiven if you feel like campaign season is already upon us.

We’re keeping track of where all possible presidential candidates stand: Who’s running, who isn’t running, and, when the time comes, 
       who has dropped out. We’ll be updating this list as candidates declare their intentions, so keep checking in. </p>

              New Bedford, and Jose M. Martinez, 34, of Boston.Green’s brother, Jomar, recalled him as a funny, 
              loving man who enjoyed football, baseball, and his mother’s home cooking.
              He grew up in the neighborhood and attended The English High School.</br></p>

<p></br> Suppose the new arrivals from Woking helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, 
  intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the 
  evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and
  advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.
  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

         <p>  I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet
           I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
           and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams
           steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, 
           as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little
           world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, 
           then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath.</p></div>
